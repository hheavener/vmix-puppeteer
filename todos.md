# To Do

### Implement components

[shad-cn](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) for most components (individually installed)

[Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) mainly for:

- keyboard controls
- code mockups
- masks
- diff

[Radix UI tree](https://www.radix-vue.com/components/tree.html)

See this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/18ecyja/vue_ui_kitscomponent_libraries/?rdt=37912)

### Implement logic structure

When creating a new program, it should be backed by a vmix preset file.

- Programs should be given a unique name (possibly UUID also) and saved with a pointer to the vmix save file they were created from
